## A simple Sudoku game designed to run on a web server.

Personaly I run this on a Raspberry Pi 5, running the stock Raspberry Pi OS.

* Web Server: Caddy
* Python environment: uv venv
* To access the game from outside my house I use tailscale

Feel free to use and modify.  This was 100% created by Google Gemini.  I've not edited a single line of code, only massaged the setup for Caddy and the RPI5 systemd .service file as needed
